Rails API - https://github.com/ramell86/tasks-rails-api

to use:
first, clone both the Rails api - git@github.com:ramell86/tasks-rails-api.git
      and the front end directory - git@github.com:ramell86/tasks-js-frontend.git

Next, cd into the rails api directory and run 'rails s' to start the server,  Keeping the server running open a new command line and cd into the tasks-js-frontend directory.

Open up the index.html file in the root of the tasks-js-frontend directory and you should then be able to use the app.
